# Design Resources

There is a good amount of resources regarding utility AI from Dave Mark's book to his videos and other things which all can be found in this wiki page of a utility AI sandbox project [here](https://github-wiki-see.page/m/apoch/curvature/wiki/Utility-Theory-Crash-Course).

We are not associated with that project or Mr. Mark but his book and these videos were very useful to us so we thought it might help you guys too and hopefully we give back a bit to him by sending a few potential book purchases over.
