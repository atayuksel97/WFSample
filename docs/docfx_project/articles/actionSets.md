# Action Sets

An action set contains a set of actions and is mainly used like a directory for grouping similar actions together in the editor window and doesn't introduce any functional difference to your actions and their scoring.
Other than visual organization uses, you can add an action set to a `Brain` component at runtime which is more specific than adding all action sets of an agent behavior asset.

To add an action set

- you select an agent behavior asset in the project view and open the *Window>NoOpArmy>Wise Feline* window.
- Click Add Action Set button to add a new action set.

Then the action set can be deleted by selecting it and pressing the delete button. It also can be renamed by selecting it and then changing the name property in the inspector of the wise feline window.
Of course while selected you can add actions to it as well which is the main point of having action sets.
