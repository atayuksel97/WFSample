# The demo

There is a Demo folder in the asset which is a sample application.

# How to run the demo

Simply running the DemoScene in the Demo/Scenes folder will run the demo.
You can press tab to focus the camera on the different agents in the scene.

# Important Folders

- Scripts contains all the code for the agents including the considerations, actions and the components which they call.
- Scripts/UtilityAI contains all the actions and considerations which are made for the demo's AI.
- Scripts/Gameplay are the general scripts for controlling the camera and overal flow of the scene
- Scripts/Agent are the components attached to agents which actions call for attacking and moving and ...
- UtilityAI contains all the [Agent Behaviors](behaviors.md) which are used by the agents.

Rest of the folders are pretty self explanatory and we will add more documentation for the sample as we move forward.
