# The sample

There is a sample in the project with two levels.
One is pretty simple and without AI controllers and another is a FPS and has lots of actions and considerations with FPS enemies fully made in utility AI.

Download the sample from [GitHub.](https://github.com/Shayan-Zamiri/WFSample)

# How to run the demo

In the Maps folder there are two maps, FirstPerson and Simple. Both can be simply opened and played.
